## App Inbox - Article
Inbox Articles are a common content delivery method we employ for driving affordable eyeballs and traffic to content on our owned platforms, specifically the Liven Blog, and our Medium publication.

*Here's what they look like*

To get started, log into Leanplum, and open the messaging dashboard, then navigate to a message called !!! TEMPLATE - Article Inbox. In most cases, templates are denoted by Live messages named with !!!

From here, simply create a duplicate message by clicking the context menu, and hitting copy (to the same app you started in)

You should now be in a view of an identical message marked (copy). From here, begin populating content according to the format of the template. For articles, the content requires:

1. PNG Banner image 1200x600
2. Headline copy
3. Subheading copy
4. Link out to blog or content

Here's an example of an image we might use.

**Please note, 2:1 ratio is critical for these images, and start with a high quality image before cropping down.**
